# Unix 02
This exercise is one of our challenges to help you learn more about Unix/Linux

### LOGGING IN
In this challenge, you can log in using the username pentesterlab and the password pentesterlab.

### THE CHALLENGE
This challenge is very similar to the previous exercise. The main difference is the permissions set on the victim directory. 
This time, you won't be able to list the content of the **/home/victim** directory. But you can still use cat to get the content of the key.txt file.
