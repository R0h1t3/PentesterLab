# Unix 01
This exercise is one of our challenges to help you learn more about Unix/Linux

### LOGGING IN
In this challenge, you can log in using the username pentesterlab and the password pentesterlab.

### THE CHALLENGE
In this challenge, the key is in the home directory of another user. To get to that directory, you can use the cd command. You can go up one directory using:
```
cd ..
```
Once, you're there. You can use ls to list the content of this directory. You should see your current home directory pentesterlab and the target's home directory: victim. You can then move to the victim directory using:

```
cd victim
```
Once there, you can use ls to check what files are available and cat to get the key.
