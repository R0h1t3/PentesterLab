# Unix 03
This exercise is one of our challenges to help you learn more about Unix/Linux

### LOGGING IN
In this challenge, you can log in using the username pentesterlab and the password pentesterlab.

### THE CHALLENGE
When using a Unix system, it's pretty handy to remember what commands you ran. To do that most shells (where you type the command) keep a file with a list of the previous commands. Here the victim is using bash. The shell bash uses the file .bash_history in the home directory of the user running the commands. The fact that the filename starts with a dot . indicates that it's a hidden file.

Obviously, the list of previous commands ran by the victim can potentially contain interesting information. Here we can get access to this file by:

Going to the home directory of the victim.
Listing the content of this directory using **ls -a** (the option -a will show the hidden files).
Reading the content of the file using cat and trying to find something that looks like a key.

## Solution
