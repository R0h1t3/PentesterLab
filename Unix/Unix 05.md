# Unix 05
This exercise is one of our challenges to help you learn more about Unix/Linux

### LOGGING IN
In this challenge, you can log in using the username pentesterlab and the password pentesterlab.

### THE CHALLENGE
In this challenge, you will learn about the .bashrc file. This file is loaded when a user start a new shell. It's often used to configure the shell or to load some information. For example, you can use it to define aliases for command or to save some variables.

To find the **.bashrc** files we have access to, we can use the **find** command. We can tell find to search for all the files named .bashrc in the** /home** directory:
```
find /home -name .bashrc
```
From there, you should be able to retrieve the key like in the previous exercises by looking at all the files. Unfortunately, this is not efficient. 
The key is used in a command to define an alias that will allow the user to just type check instead of the full (fake) command **check_ptlab_key** .... Using the argument **-exec** of the find command you should be able to grep for the check keywords:
```
find /home -name .bashrc -exec grep [PATTERN] {} \;
```
Where **[PATTERN]** should be replaced by the pattern you're searching for.

During a review, it's also important to look at the .bash_profile that gets loaded when users log in via a console.
