# Unix 04
This exercise is one of our challenges to help you learn more about Unix/Linux

### LOGGING IN
In this challenge, you can log in using the username pentesterlab and the password pentesterlab.

### THE CHALLENGE
In the previous challenge, we checked the .bash_history of one user. On most systems, you will have a lot more users and you will need to work faster.

To do this, we can use the find command. We can tell find to search for all the files named .bash_history in the /home directory:
```
find /home -name .bash_history
```
From there, you should be able to retrieve the key like in the previous exercise.
