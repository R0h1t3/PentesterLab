# Introduction 03
This exercise will guide through the process of scoring an exercise to mark it as completed. However, this time, you will run commands on the underlying operating system. You will need to run the score command with your UUID.

### THIS CHALLENGE
Here, you need to start using the functionality as it was intended to be used. This will give you an idea of what the code does.
You can see that you provide an IP address and that the application is running the command ping with the IP address we provided.
It’s running a command. Let see if there is some way to abuse this functionality.
By doing some research, you will find that there is a type of attack referred to as command injection.

#### COMMAND INJECTION
Command injection can be used to run arbitrary commands on a server.
Multiple payloads can be used to trigger this behaviour. For example, let’s say that the initial command is:

`ping [parameter]` <br><br>
Where **[parameter]** is the value you provided in the form or in the URL.

If you look at how the command line works, you will find that there are multiple ways to add more commands:

- command1 && command2 that will run command2 if command1 succeeds.
- command1 || command2 that will run command2 if command1 fails.
- command1 ; command2 that will run command1 then command2.
- command1 | command2 that will run command1 and send the output of command1 to command2.
- ...<br><br>
In this application, we can provide a parameter to command1`, but there is no command2`. What we are going to do is add our own command.

Instead of sending the [parameter] to the command:

`ping 127.0.0.1`<br>
Where 127.0.0.1 is our [parameter]. We are going to send a malicious [parameter] that will contain another command:

`ping 127.0.0.1 ; cat /etc/passwd`<br>
The application will think that 127.0.0.1 ; cat /etc/passwd is just a parameter to run command1. But we actually injected command2: cat /etc/passwd.

Now, what we want to do is run the command to score: /usr/local/bin/score [uuid]. We can just use the line above to run this command instead of cat /etc/passwd.

## Solution
- Go to the given exercise URL.
- There will be text box which be used ti ping any IP address
- There, enter **127.0.0.1** to make the machine believe that the request is coming from the same machine.
- After the IP add **;/usr/local/bin/score UUID** - To get the information out of the vulnerable machine.
<br>Doing this will automatically solve the machine.
