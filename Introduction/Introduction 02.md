# Introduction 02
This exercise will guide through the process of scoring an exercise to mark it as completed. Finding the key is just a little bit harder than the previous exercise.

### HTML COMMENTS
HTML comments are often used to hide part of an application.

This can be done for "security" reasons, or just because a page or piece of functionality has been removed from the website.

You can easily access the source code of a page using the developer tools in Chrome or Firefox. Then you can search for comments in the HTML code.

HTML comments start with: <!-- and ends with -->.
```
 <h1>Hello world!<h1>
 <!-- This is a comment -->
```

If you find a link in the comments of a page, it's always worth visiting it.

## Solution
The HTML Contents of a web page can be viewed in the page source.<br>
For this exercise there is a directory which hidden in the comments of the HTML code of the page. Following that trail will give you the key!


**Tips:** It is always advised to go through the source code of a page to find any clues or information of the target - You never know what can be used!
