# Recon 10
This exercise covers visual content discovery

## OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to use visual reconnaissance. You will need to find the website with the key in red.

VISUAL RECONNAISSANCE
For this challenge, the web applications are hosted under: 0x["%02x"].a.hackycorp.com as in:

0x00.a.hackycorp.com
0x01.a.hackycorp.com
...
0x0a.a.hackycorp.com
0x0b.a.hackycorp.com
...
If you haven't done visual reconnaissance before, you can try to use the tool [Aquatone](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone) to get images that you can browse easily to find the right key.
