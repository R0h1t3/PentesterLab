# Recon 10
This exercise covers visual content discovery

### OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to use visual reconnaissance. You will need to find the website with the key in red.

### VISUAL RECONNAISSANCE
For this challenge, the web applications are hosted under: 0x["%02x"].a.hackycorp.com as in:<br>
<br>
0x00.a.hackycorp.com<br>
0x01.a.hackycorp.com<br>
...<br>
0x0a.a.hackycorp.com<br>
0x0b.a.hackycorp.com<br>
...<br><br>
If you haven't done visual reconnaissance before, you can try to use the tool [Aquatone](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone) to get images that you can browse easily to find the right key.

## Solution
There are different ways to solve this challenge, but this is the method I used.
- First I created a python script which gives us the of hexadecimals from 0 - ff and saved the output in url.txt file

```
def hex_in_range(n):
    for i in range(0, n+1):
        print(hex(i)[2:])

hex_in_range(255)
```
(This will create the output in which the intial hexadecimals are single digited (0-f), change them as double digited (00-0f).)<br><br>
- Next I used **sed** to add prefix and suffix to the obtained hexadecimals to form the urls in the given format.<br>

```
sed -i s/$/.a.hackycorp.com/ url.txt 
```

```
sed -i -e 's/^/0x/' url.txt  
```

- Finally used aquatone to get the screenshots of the urls which responds to it.<br>

```
cat url.txt | ./aquatone
```

Then aquatone creates an html file with the screenshots of the urls that we gave. In one of them the key will be present.<br>
(**Hint:** The key will be in red color:shushing_face:)
