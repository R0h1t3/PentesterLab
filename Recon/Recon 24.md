In this challenge, you need to look for a file named key.txt in the place used to serve the assets for the main website

### OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to look at the server used to load assets (JavaScript, CSS) and find a file named key.txt.

### WHY?
It's essential to look for files that may be publicly available on the servers used to load assets.

## Solution
Since we are looking for the server which is used to load the assets fro the [Hackcorp](http://hackycorp.com/) page -> Go to the source page<br>

<br> From the screenshot it is clearly visible that all the assests are loaded from `assests.hackycorp.com`.<br>
Go to the page directly is returing us with an error.<br>
But from the given text of the exercise we know that the key is saved in a file name `key.txt`.<br>
So, navigate to key.txt file by adding it to the asset's server url. And the key will be reveled.<br>
