# Recon 12

### OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to access a load-balanced application hosted at the address balancer.hackycorp.com.

## LOAD BALANCING
Serving requests for a single application can be done by multiple backends.<br>
It can pay off to send the same request multiple times to check if multiple backends are involved.

## Solution
Intercept the request in proxy - **Burp Suite** and read the response. It will have the key in it.<br>
