### OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to brute a virtual host.

### VIRTUAL HOST BRUTE FORCING
In this challenge, you need to brute force a virtual host by only manipulating the Host header. There is no DNS resolution setup for this host.<br>
Therefore you will need to target hackycorp.com and bruteforce the virtual host (that ends in **.hackycorp.com**).<br>

## Solution
