This exercise covers default vhost

OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to access the default virtual host ("vhost").

FUZZING DIRECTORIES
When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to replace the hostname with the IP address or to provide a random Host header in the request. To do this, you can either modify the request in a web proxy or use:
```
curl -H "Host: ...."
```

# Solution
To find the default vhost for the give web application, we have to first find the ip address of the application.
To find that - Open your terminal and type 
```
ping hackycorp.com
```
which will give us with the IP Address of the web application.<br>
Then go to that IP Address and the key will appear.
