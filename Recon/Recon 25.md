In this challenge, you need to look for a file named key2.txt in the place used to serve the assets for the main website

### OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to look at the server used to load assets (JavaScript, CSS) and find a file named key2.txt. However, this time you will need to be logged in to access it.
