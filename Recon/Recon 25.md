In this challenge, you need to look for a file named key2.txt in the place used to serve the assets for the main website

### OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to look at the server used to load assets (JavaScript, CSS) and find a file named key2.txt. However, this time you will need to be logged in to access it.

Amazon Web Services Storage Service (S3) allows file owners to set permissions on files. Historically, the rules "Any users" wasn't well explained and lead a lot of people to think only people in their Amazon account could access a file. However, this was allowing any AWS account to access the file.

### WHY?
It's essential to look for files that may be publicly available on the servers used to load assets.

## Solutions
Here directly accessing the the https://assets.hackycorp.com/key2.txt webpage is returning with an error.<br>

<br> From the description of the exercise we can deduce that the file's owner is using **AWS S3** services for the storage of the file. Here, it is not accessible for a normal user but sometimes these files are accessible to answer user logged in AWS S3 bucket services.<br>

So, install awscli in your termminal.<br>
Linux - `sudo apt install awscli`<br>
Mac - `brew install awscli`<br>
Windows - `msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi`<br>

Then create an aws account and retrive your **key id** and **secret** from your account.<br>
Then use `aws config` to enter the key id and the secret to configure the aws.<br>
This would have created a **~/.aws** directory. Goto that folder to see the contents of it<br>

Generally the domain name is the S3 bucket name, so in this case the bucket name is **assets.hackycorp.com**.<br>

With the help of `aws help`, try to learn different subcommands in aws.<br>

To extract the info from the aws S3 bucket use this command.

` aws s3 cp s3://domainname(or)URL/[file] $localfilename`

Using this above command for our situation appropriately will give you the flag.
