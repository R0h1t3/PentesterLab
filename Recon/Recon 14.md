In this challenge, you need to find a TXT record by doing a zone transfer on z.hackycorp.com

### OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to perform a zone transfer on z.hackycorp.com.

### ZONE TRANSFER
Zone transfers are usually used to synchronise multiple DNS servers. Only a list of pre-defined hosts should be able to perform this operation. <br>
However, it's sometimes possible to retrieve this information and can give you access to new hosts.

## Solution
To perform the Zone transer attack we have find the name server on the domain is running. **dig** is the best tool to use for this purpose.
```
dig z.hackycorp.com -t ns
```

Here the name server is the same as the domain name.(This might not be true for all the cases)<br>
And to perform the Zone tranfer attack.
```
dig axfr z.hackycorp.com @z.hackycorp.com
```
Here the first URL is the domain name and second on after @ is the name server.<br>
This will give the key!
