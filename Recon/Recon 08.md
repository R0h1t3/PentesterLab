# Recon 08
This exercise covers aliases in TLS certificates

## OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to access the alternative names in the certificate.

## ALTERNATIVE NAMES
When accessing a TLS server, it often pays off to check the content of the certificate used. It's common for TLS servers to have certificates that are valid for more than one name (named alternative names). Looking for alternative names can be done in your client or by using openssl.

# Solution
In order to solve this challenge you have to have a basic understanding of **openssl**.<br>
To get the alternative names for the given doamin, you have to enter this openssl command in the terminal.
```
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text | grep -C3 -i dns
```
(Change example.com to the given URL)<br><br>
Its result will give us 3 DNS records names for this given URL. In One of them the key will be present.<br><br>
