# Recon 17
In this challenge, you need to look at the name of the developer used in the repository test1

### OBJECTIVE
I must say this is the easiest recon you can perform in this exercise of Recon Module. <br>
- A normal google search for **hackycorp github** will give us the github account account.
- And then navigate to the **test1** repo of theirs<br>

The flag will be right in front of your eyes!
