# Recon 15
In this challenge, you need to find a TXT record by doing a zone transfer on the internal zone "int"

### OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to perform a zone transfer on the internal zone named: "int" using the nameserver of z.hackycorp.com.

### ZONE TRANSFER
Zone transfers are usually used to synchronise multiple DNS servers. Only a list of pre-defined hosts should be able to perform this operation. 
However, it's sometimes possible to retrieve information from internal zones by asking publicly available servers.

## Solution
This is one similar to Recon 14. Here only the doman name chnges to **int**, but the name server remains the same as said in the exercise.
```
dig axfr int @z.hackycorp.com
```
