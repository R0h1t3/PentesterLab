# Recon 05
This exercise covers simple directory bruteforcing

## OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to find a directory that is not directly accessible.

## FUZZING DIRECTORIES
When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to brute force directories. To do this, you can use many tools like [patator](https://github.com/lanjelot/patator), [FFUF](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) or [WFuzz](https://wfuzz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (amongst many others).

# Solution
Since the aim of the exercise is to **find a directory that is not directly accessible**, this means our key in the pages which are **redirect pages** which have a http response code of **301**.<br>
I personally prefer **ffuf** because it is super easy in the CLI.<br>

Here **-mc** flag provides us with only directories which responds with 301 http response<br>
Intially in the previous challenges we have already seen umages and admin directory. So we can explore the other directory.<br><br>
