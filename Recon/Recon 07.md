This exercise covers default TLS vhost

## OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to access the default virtual host ("vhost") over TLS.

## DEFAULT VHOST OVER TLS
When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to replace the hostname with the IP address or to provide a random Host header in the request. To do this, you can either modify the request in a web proxy or use:

`curl -H "Host: ...."`

This time you need to check the TLS version of the website to get the key

# Solution
Following the instruction, open Burp Suite and intercept the request<br>

Then changes the Host: value to any random character. Key will be obtained.
