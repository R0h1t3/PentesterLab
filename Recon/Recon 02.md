# Recon 02
This exercise covers the security.txt file

## OBJECTIVE
For this challenge, your goal is to retrieve the security.txt from the main website for hackycorp.com.

## THE SECURITY.TXT FILE
The security.txt file is used to tell security researchers how they can disclose vulnerabilities for a website. 
You can learn more about it here: [securitytxt.org](https://securitytxt.org/) and on Wikipedia: [Security.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security.txt).

# Solutions
Usually adding **/security.txt** will give us the security.txt page. But that is not happening in this case, because that file is placed in another directory.<br>
- Add **/.well-known/security.txt** to the given URL - This will give the **key**.
